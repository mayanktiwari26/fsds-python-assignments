        "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer1. Functions are advantageous as they increase program readability, avoid  repetition, converts complex problem into simple one, reduces chance of error and makes it easier to modify the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. When does the code in a function run: when it is specified or when it is called?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer2. code in a function runs when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer3. def functionName(arguments):\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer4. We define functions to perform a particular task, a function call is basically a way to call that function in order to perform the task.\n",
        "eg. # function Sum to add two numbers\n",
        "    def Sum(a,b):\n",
        "      return a+b\n",
        "    # now to use Sum function we will call it using function call\n",
        "    Sum(1,2)\n",
        "    # this will return value 3\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer5. A python program has only one global scope and can have any no. of local scopes. \n",
        "\n",
        "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer6. After the function call returns the variable is gone and the memory is assigned to some other variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "eg. in above Sum(a,b): function if we check the address of variable 'a' outside the function it will throw error.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer7. A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. \n",
        "A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. \n",
        "The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes it can be in the form of expression\n",
        "\n",
        "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer8. If a function doesn't have return value statement it returns 'None'\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer9. Any global variable can be used inside a function to refer it use the same name.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer11. It will throw a ModuleNotFoundError if you dont have any module by the same name in your current working directory,\n",
        "if you have it will import that module.\n",

        "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",

        "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer14. we keep that code inside try clause which might throw error and handle that error inside except clause.\n",
